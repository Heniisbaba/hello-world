# hello-world
First of many

Well here we are eight months after starting my coding journey, I am finally learning git.
 I Know the timing is awkwardly awkward. Yea you can berate me.
 
    I naturally hate making excuses so i won't make one except that studying mathematics here is resisting coding,
 In the past eight months, i can say I am still a beginner in coding.
